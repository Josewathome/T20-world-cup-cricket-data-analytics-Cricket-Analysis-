# Project: T20 world cup cricket data analytics Cricket Analysis
Welcome to the T20 Cricket Team Selection Analytics project repository! This project combines web scraping, data analysis, and Power BI to create a data-driven approach for assembling a top-performing T20 cricket team. By defining specific criteria for player categories and evaluating player performance metrics, we aim to build a team capable of scoring a minimum of 180 runs while defending 150 runs on average. The included resources and code demonstrate how this data analytics project enhances cricket team selection, increasing the team's chances of success.
